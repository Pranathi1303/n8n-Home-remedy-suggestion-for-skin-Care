# Skincare Home Remedies AI Workflow
## Intelligent Natural Skincare Solution Finder

### ðŸŒ¿ Project Overview
The Skincare Home Remedies AI Workflow is an intelligent automation system that transforms traditional skincare knowledge into an accessible, AI-powered consultation platform. By combining natural language processing with a comprehensive database of home remedies, this workflow provides personalized skincare recommendations based on individual skin concerns and conditions.

### ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
